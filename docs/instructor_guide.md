## Day 1: Terraform Fundamentals

### Morning Session (4 hours)

#### 9:00-9:30 | Course Introduction & Environment Setup (30 min)
**Teaching Notes:**
- Keep introductions brief but establish rapport
- Focus on setup verification, not lengthy explanations
- Use "raise hand" method for quick troubleshooting

**Key Points:**
- Course structure overview (2 minutes)
- Individual introductions (10 minutes)
- Environment verification lab (15 minutes)
- Troubleshooting time (3 minutes)

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
- **Permission errors**: Pre-provision IAM roles
- **Network restrictions**: Have mobile hotspot ready
- **Version conflicts**: Provide Docker container option

**Interactive Elements:**
```bash
# Quick verification script
echo "Let's verify your setup..."
terraform --version
aws --version
echo "If you see versions above, you're ready!"
```

#### 9:30-10:00 | Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (30 min)
**Teaching Strategy:**
- Start with a "show of hands" survey about current practices
- Use real war stories to illustrate IaC benefits
- Keep this conversational, not lecture-style

**Key Messages:**
1. **The Pain Points**: Manual processes, human errors, inconsistency
2. **The Solution**: Code-based infrastructure management
3. **The Benefits**: Speed, consistency, collaboration, version control

**Interactive Demo:**
```hcl
# Show this transformation
# FROM: Manual AWS console clicks
# TO: This simple code:
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "MyWebServer"
  }
}
```

**Discussion Prompt:**
"What's the biggest infrastructure headache you've experienced? How might IaC have helped?"

#### 10:00-10:45 | Terraform Basics Lab (45 min)
**Lab Objective**: Get hands dirty immediately with working Terraform

**Instructor Role:**
- Circulate constantly
- Help struggling participants immediately
- Pair experienced participants with beginners
- Announce common mistakes as you see them

**Lab Structure:**
```hcl
# Step 1: Simple resource (10 min)
resource "random_pet" "server" {}

# Step 2: AWS resource (15 min) 
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.latest.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = random_pet.server.id
  }
}

# Step 3: Explore and experiment (20 min)
```

**Coaching Tips:**
- "Don't worry about understanding everything yet"
- "Focus on the workflow: init, plan, apply"
- "Experimentation is encouraged"

**Assessment Checkpoint:**
- Can they run `terraform init`?
- Do they understand the plan output?
- Are they comfortable with apply/destroy?

#### 11:00-11:30 | Terraform Building Blocks (30 min)
**Teaching Method**: Build on what they just experienced

**Core Concepts:**
1. **Providers** (use AWS as primary example)
2. **Resources** (expand on what they just created)  
3. **Data Sources** (show AMI lookup)
4. **Configuration Files** (explain the structure)

**Interactive Explanation:**
```hcl
# Walk through this together
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"  # "This is like importing a library"
      version = "~> 5.0"         # "Version constraints prevent surprises"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"  # "Configuration for the provider"
}

data "aws_ami" "latest" {  # "This queries existing infrastructure"
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {  # "This creates new infrastructure"
  ami           = data.aws_ami.latest.id  # "Using the data we queried"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

#### 11:30-12:30 | Terraform Workflow Lab (60 min)
**Objective**: Master the core workflow through repetition

**Lab Design:**
- **Iteration 1** (20 min): Basic instance creation
- **Iteration 2** (20 min): Add tags and security group
- **Iteration 3** (20 min): Modify and observe changes

**Teaching During Lab:**
- Show plan output interpretation
- Explain resource address format
- Demonstrate dependency relationships

**Key Learning Points:**
```bash
# Emphasize this workflow
terraform init     # "One time setup"
terraform plan     # "What will change?"
terraform apply    # "Make it so"
terraform show     # "What do I have?"
terraform destroy  # "Clean up"
```

### Afternoon Session (4 hours)

#### 1:30-3:00 | Extended Infrastructure Lab (90 min)
**Purpose**: Build complexity gradually while reinforcing basics

**Lab Progression:**
1. **Network Foundation** (30 min): VPC, subnets, routing
2. **Security Configuration** (30 min): Security groups, NACLs  
3. **Compute Resources** (30 min): Multiple instances, load balancer

**Instructor Strategy:**
- Provide starter templates to save time
- Focus on relationships between resources
- Encourage exploration of plan output

**Sample Progression:**
```hcl
# Phase 1: Networking
module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  # ... configuration
}

# Phase 2: Security
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  # ... rules
}

# Phase 3: Compute
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count = 2
  # ... configuration with dependencies
}
```

**Coaching Points:**
- "Notice how Terraform resolves dependencies automatically"
- "The plan output shows the creation order"
- "Each resource has a unique address"

#### 3:15-3:45 | State Management Theory (30 min)
**Teaching Approach**: Start with problems, then solutions

**Problem Illustration:**
"What happens if two people run Terraform at the same time?"
"How does Terraform know what it created?"

**Concept Build:**
1. **Local State** (show the file)
2. **State Locking** (explain the problem)
3. **Remote State** (show S3 configuration)
4. **State Commands** (demonstrate inspection)

**Live Demo:**
```bash
# Show these operations
terraform state list
terraform state show aws_instance.web
terraform state mv aws_instance.web aws_instance.web_server

# Explain what each does and when to use them
```

#### 3:45-4:45 | State Management Lab (60 min)
**Lab Focus**: Hands-on state manipulation

**Exercises:**
1. **State Inspection** (15 min): Explore current state
2. **Remote Backend Setup** (30 min): Configure S3 backend
3. **State Migration** (15 min): Move from local to remote

**Backend Configuration:**
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-2"
  }
}
```

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
- **Bucket permissions**: Pre-create with proper policies
- **State locking**: Show DynamoDB table creation
- **Migration fears**: "We can always restore from backup"

#### 4:45-5:00 | Day 1 Review & Q&A (15 min)
**Review Method**: Rapid-fire recap

**Key Concepts Check:**
- "What's the difference between a resource and data source?"
- "What's the Terraform workflow?"
- "Why do we need state management?"
- "What did you find most challenging today?"

**Preview Tomorrow:**
"Tomorrow we'll build on these fundamentals with variables, modules, and team collaboration"

---

## Day 2: Mastering Terraform Configuration

### Morning Session (4 hours)

#### 9:00-9:15 | Day 1 Quick Recap (15 min)
**Format**: Interactive quiz

**Questions:**
1. "Who can show us the basic Terraform workflow?" (volunteer demo)
2. "What does `terraform plan` actually do?" (discussion)
3. "Why do we use remote state?" (problems → solutions)

**Energy Building**: 
"Today we're going to make your Terraform code production-ready!"

#### 9:15-9:45 | Variables and Outputs Theory (30 min)
**Teaching Method**: Problem → Solution → Best Practice

**Problem Setup:**
```hcl
# Show this "bad" code
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"  # Hardcoded!
  instance_type = "t2.micro"     # What if we need different sizes?
  
  tags = {
    Name = "MyWebServer"  # Same name everywhere?
  }
}
```

**Solution Evolution:**
```hcl
# Step 1: Basic variables
variable "instance_type" {
  type    = string
  default = "t2.micro"
}

# Step 2: Complex variables  
variable "server_config" {
  type = object({
    instance_type = string
    ami_id       = string
    name         = string
  })
}

# Step 3: Validation
variable "environment" {
  type = string
  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be dev, staging, or prod."
  }
}
```

**Interactive Elements:**
- "What other values should we make configurable?"
- "When would you use validation rules?"

#### 9:45-11:00 | Variables Deep Dive Lab (75 min)
**Lab Structure**: Progressive complexity

**Exercise 1: Basic Variables** (25 min)
```hcl
# participants create these
variable "region" { }
variable "instance_type" { }
variable "key_name" { }

# Then use them
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.latest.id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  key_name      = var.key_name
  # ...
}
```

**Exercise 2: Complex Variables** (25 min)
```hcl
# Introduce complex types
variable "servers" {
  type = map(object({
    instance_type = string
    subnet_id    = string
    tags         = map(string)
  }))
}

# Use with for_each
resource "aws_instance" "servers" {
  for_each = var.servers
  # ...
}
```

**Exercise 3: Variable Files** (25 min)
- Create dev.tfvars, staging.tfvars, prod.tfvars
- Test with `terraform plan -var-file="dev.tfvars"`

**Instructor Coaching:**
- "Don't try to understand everything at once"
- "Focus on the pattern: declare, use, customize"
- "Variable files are for different environments"

#### 11:15-12:30 | Environment Configuration Lab (75 min)
**Objective**: Build environment-specific configurations

**Lab Design:**
Participants build the same infrastructure with three different configurations:
- **Dev**: Small, single instance, basic monitoring
- **Staging**: Medium, 2 instances, enhanced monitoring  
- **Prod**: Large, 3+ instances, full monitoring, backups

**Guided Structure:**
```hcl
# locals.tf
locals {
  environment_config = {
    dev = {
      instance_type = "t2.micro"
      instance_count = 1
      enable_monitoring = false
    }
    staging = {
      instance_type = "t3.small"  
      instance_count = 2
      enable_monitoring = true
    }
    prod = {
      instance_type = "t3.large"
      instance_count = 3
      enable_monitoring = true
    }
  }
  
  current_config = local.environment_config[var.environment]
}
```

**Teaching Points:**
- "Notice how we avoid repetition"
- "One codebase, multiple deployments"
- "locals vs variables - when to use which"

### Afternoon Session (4 hours)

#### 1:30-2:00 | Module Concepts (30 min)
**Teaching Strategy**: Real-world analogy

**Analogy**: "Modules are like functions in programming"
- Input parameters (variables)
- Internal logic (resources)
- Return values (outputs)
- Reusability across projects

**Problem Illustration:**
```hcl
# Without modules - repetitive
resource "aws_vpc" "dev" { /* lots of config */ }
resource "aws_subnet" "dev_public_1" { /* lots of config */ }
resource "aws_subnet" "dev_public_2" { /* lots of config */ }
# ... 20+ resources for networking

# With modules - clean
module "networking" {
  source = "./modules/networking"
  
  environment = "dev"
  vpc_cidr   = "10.0.0.0/16"
  az_count   = 2
}
```

**Module Structure Demo:**
```
modules/
├── networking/
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── variables.tf
│   ├── outputs.tf
│   └── README.md
```

#### 2:00-3:45 | Comprehensive Module Lab (105 min)
**Lab Objective**: Build and use production-quality modules

**Phase 1: Create Networking Module** (35 min)
```hcl
# modules/networking/variables.tf
variable "environment" {
  type = string
}

variable "vpc_cidr" {
  type = string
}

variable "availability_zones" {
  type = list(string)
}

# modules/networking/main.tf
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = var.vpc_cidr
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.environment}-vpc"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}

# ... more resources

# modules/networking/outputs.tf
output "vpc_id" {
  value = aws_vpc.main.id
}

output "public_subnet_ids" {
  value = aws_subnet.public[*].id  
}
```

**Phase 2: Create Compute Module** (35 min)
```hcl
# modules/compute/variables.tf
variable "vpc_id" {}
variable "subnet_ids" {}
variable "instance_count" {}
variable "instance_type" {}

# modules/compute/main.tf
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  vpc_id = var.vpc_id
  # ... rules
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count                  = var.instance_count
  ami                   = data.aws_ami.latest.id
  instance_type         = var.instance_type
  subnet_id            = var.subnet_ids[count.index % length(var.subnet_ids)]
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web.id]
  
  tags = {
    Name = "web-${count.index + 1}"
  }
}
```

**Phase 3: Compose Modules** (35 min)
```hcl
# main.tf
module "networking" {
  source = "./modules/networking"
  
  environment        = var.environment
  vpc_cidr          = var.vpc_cidr
  availability_zones = var.availability_zones
}

module "compute" {
  source = "./modules/compute"
  
  vpc_id         = module.networking.vpc_id
  subnet_ids     = module.networking.public_subnet_ids
  instance_count = var.instance_count
  instance_type  = var.instance_type
}
```

**Instructor Coaching:**
- "Modules should have a single responsibility"
- "Good modules work in any environment"
- "Always include README.md with examples"

#### 4:00-4:15 | Collaboration Overview (15 min)
**Focus**: Team workflows and workspace management

**Key Concepts:**
- **Workspaces**: Multiple environments from one codebase
- **Remote Execution**: Terraform Cloud/Enterprise
- **Team Access**: Role-based permissions

**Live Demo:**
```bash
# Workspace management
terraform workspace list
terraform workspace new development
terraform workspace select development
terraform plan
```

#### 4:15-4:45 | Workspace Management Lab (30 min)
**Lab Focus**: Practical workspace usage

**Exercise Flow:**
1. **Create workspaces** for dev, staging, prod
2. **Deploy same code** to different workspaces
3. **Show workspace isolation** with `terraform state list`
4. **Practice switching** between workspaces

**Teaching Points:**
- "Each workspace has its own state"
- "Same code, different data"
- "Perfect for environment management"

#### 4:45-5:00 | Day 2 Review & Preview (15 min)
**Review Format**: "Teach back"

Ask participants to explain:
- "How would you explain variables to a colleague?"
- "When would you create a new module?"
- "Why use workspaces instead of separate directories?"

---

## Day 3: Advanced Terraform Techniques and Real-World Applications

### Morning Session (4 hours)

#### 9:00-9:15 | Day 2 Quick Recap (15 min)
**Interactive Review:**
- "Show me your favorite module from yesterday"
- "What's the difference between locals and variables?"
- "How do workspaces help with team collaboration?"

#### 9:15-9:45 | Multi-Cloud Strategies (30 min)
**Teaching Approach**: Business case first, technical implementation second

**Business Scenarios:**
1. **Vendor Risk Mitigation**: "Don't put all eggs in one basket"
2. **Compliance Requirements**: "Data must stay in specific regions/clouds"
3. **Cost Optimization**: "Use best price/performance for each workload"
4. **Disaster Recovery**: "Geographic distribution for resilience"

**Technical Implementation:**
```hcl
# Multi-provider configuration
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

# Provider configurations
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

provider "google" {
  project = "my-project"
  region  = "us-central1"
}
```

#### 9:45-10:45 | Multi-Cloud Setup Lab (60 min)
**Lab Objective**: Deploy resources across multiple clouds

**Exercise Structure:**
- **AWS**: Primary application infrastructure
- **Azure**: Backup storage and disaster recovery
- **GCP**: Analytics and machine learning workloads

**Simplified Example:**
```hcl
# AWS - Main application
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.latest.id
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "Primary-Web-Server"
    Cloud = "AWS"
  }
}

# Azure - Backup storage
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "backup" {
  name                     = "${var.project_name}backup${var.environment}"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  location                = "East US"
  account_tier            = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"
  
  tags = {
    purpose = "backup"
    cloud   = "Azure"
  }
}

# GCP - Analytics
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "analytics" {
  dataset_id = "${var.project_name}_analytics_${var.environment}"
  location   = "US"
  
  labels = {
    purpose = "analytics"
    cloud   = "gcp"
  }
}
```

**Instructor Focus:**
- "Each cloud has strengths - use them appropriately"
- "Provider configuration is key"
- "State management becomes more complex"

#### 11:00-12:30 | Production Multi-Cloud Lab (90 min)
**Advanced Scenario**: Complete multi-cloud architecture

**Architecture Overview:**
- **AWS**: Primary compute, networking, databases
- **Azure**: Backup, disaster recovery, Windows workloads  
- **GCP**: Data analytics, machine learning

**Lab Components:**
1. **Cross-cloud networking** (VPC peering, VPN)
2. **Data replication** (S3 → Azure Blob → GCS)
3. **Disaster recovery** (automated failover)

**Sample Advanced Configuration:**
```hcl
# Cross-cloud data replication
resource "aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration" "azure_backup" {
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_versioning.source]
  
  role   = aws_iam_role.replication.arn
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.source.id
  
  rule {
    id     = "replicate-to-azure"
    status = "Enabled"
    
    destination {
      bucket        = "arn:aws:s3:::${azurerm_storage_account.backup.name}"
      storage_class = "STANDARD_IA"
    }
  }
}

# Cross-cloud networking
resource "aws_vpn_connection" "azure_connection" {
  customer_gateway_id = aws_customer_gateway.azure.id
  type               = "ipsec.1"
  vpn_gateway_id     = aws_vpn_gateway.main.id
  
  tags = {
    Name = "AWS-Azure-VPN"
  }
}
```

**Teaching Strategy:**
- Provide scaffold code to save time
- Focus on concepts, not syntax memorization
- Emphasize real-world applicability

### Afternoon Session (4 hours)

#### 1:30-2:00 | Advanced Terraform Functions (30 min)
**Teaching Method**: Problem-solution pairs

**Common Scenarios:**
1. **Data Transformation**: Converting between formats
2. **Conditional Logic**: Environment-based decisions
3. **Loop Constructs**: Handling lists and maps
4. **String Manipulation**: Generating names and paths

**Live Coding Examples:**
```hcl
# Conditional resource creation
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count = var.environment == "prod" ? 3 : 1
  
  instance_type = (
    var.environment == "prod" ? "t3.large" :
    var.environment == "staging" ? "t3.medium" :
    "t3.small"
  )
}

# Complex loops
locals {
  server_configs = {
    for server in var.servers : server.name => {
      instance_type = lookup(server, "instance_type", "t3.micro")
      subnet_id    = var.subnets[server.availability_zone]
      
      tags = merge(
        var.default_tags,
        server.tags,
        {
          Name = "${var.project_name}-${server.name}"
          AZ   = server.availability_zone
        }
      )
    }
  }
}

# String functions
locals {
  resource_names = [
    for i in range(var.instance_count) :
    "${var.project_name}-web-${format("%02d", i + 1)}"
  ]
  
  backup_bucket_name = replace(
    lower("${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-backups"),
    "_",
    "-"
  )
}
```

#### 2:00-3:45 | Complete Automation Lab (105 min)
**Capstone Exercise**: End-to-end automated infrastructure

**Project**: Deploy a complete web application stack with:

  source = "./modules/security"
  
  vpc_id = module.networking.vpc_id
  
  allowed_cidr_blocks = var.allowed_cidr_blocks
  database_access_sgs = [module.compute.app_security_group_id]
}
```

**Phase 2: Application Tier** (40 min)
```hcl
# Load balancer and auto-scaling
module "web_tier" {
  source = "./modules/web-tier"
  
  vpc_id                = module.networking.vpc_id
  public_subnet_ids     = module.networking.public_subnet_ids
  private_subnet_ids    = module.networking.private_subnet_ids
  web_security_group_id = module.security.web_security_group_id
  
  min_size     = var.web_tier_min_size
  max_size     = var.web_tier_max_size
  desired_size = var.web_tier_desired_size
  
  health_check_path = "/health"
  
  tags = local.common_tags
}

# Application servers
module "app_tier" {

## Learning Challenges

### Overwhelming Complexity
**Challenge**: Participants feeling overwhelmed by options and complexity
**Solution**:
- "You don't need to memorize everything"
- Focus on patterns, not syntax
- Provide quick reference sheets
- Encourage experimentation over perfection

### Different Learning Speeds
**Challenge**: Mixed experience levels in same class
**Solution**:
- Pair experienced with beginners
- Provide "stretch goals" for quick finishers
