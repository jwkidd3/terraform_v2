### 2. Terraform Cloud Configuration Patterns
```hcl
# Workspace configuration template
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "your-org-name"
    
    workspaces {
      name = "workspace-name"
    }
  }
}

# Variable sets for credential management
# Team access controls
# Policy set configurations
# Private registry module consumption
```

### 3. AWS Resource Patterns
- **VPC**: Multi-tier networking with public/private/database subnets
- **EC2**: Auto Scaling Groups with Launch Templates  
- **Security**: Security Groups with least privilege
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
- **Storage**: S3 for state, EBS for instances
- **Database**: RDS with proper subnet groups and security

## Quality Assurance Standards

### 1. Technical Requirements
- **Terraform Syntax**: All HCL code must be syntactically correct
- **Version Consistency**: Use `required_version = ">= 1.5"` across all labs
- **AWS Services**: Use current AWS service configurations and best practices
- **Terraform Cloud**: Reference current Terraform Cloud features and UI
- **Dynamic Resources**: Always use data sources instead of hardcoded values

### 2. Educational Value
- **Progressive Learning**: Each lab builds on previous knowledge
- **Practical Skills**: Focus on real-world applicable skills
- **Enterprise Ready**: Prepare students for production environments
- **Certification Prep**: Align with HashiCorp Terraform Associate objectives

### 3. Consistency Standards
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent resource naming across labs
- **Code Style**: Uniform formatting and organization
- **Documentation**: Consistent markdown formatting and structure
- **Terminology**: Use standard Terraform and AWS terminology

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Lab Structure Issues (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Duplicate and inconsistent lab files  
**Solution**: Removed 7 obsolete files, maintained 12 correctly sequenced labs  
**Files Affected**: Multiple duplicate lab files removed

### 2. AMI Hardcoding Issues (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Hardcoded AMI IDs that would become invalid over time  
**Solution**: Replaced all hardcoded AMIs with dynamic data source lookups  
**Implementation**: 
```hcl
# Before (problematic)
ami = "ami-0e820afa569e84cc1"  # Example for us-east-2 - Use dynamic data sources in production

# After (correct)
data "aws_ami" "amazon_linux" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
  }
}
ami = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id
```

### 3. Terraform Version Inconsistency (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Mixed version requirements across labs  
**Solution**: Standardized all labs to use `required_version = ">= 1.5"`  
**Files Updated**: 9 lab files updated for consistency

### 4. Directory Structure Cleanup (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Cluttered root directory with development artifacts  
**Solution**: Streamlined to 19 essential files for class delivery  
**Structure**: Organized into logical directories (labs/, docs/, presentations/)

## User Interaction Patterns

### 1. Requirement Gathering
When users request changes:
- Confirm scope and impact
- Ask clarifying questions about specific needs
- Propose implementation approach
- Provide time estimates for changes

### 2. Iterative Development

- Test command sequences for accuracy
- Validate that labs can be completed in 45 minutes

## Troubleshooting Guidelines

### 1. Common Issues to Address
- **Permissions**: AWS IAM permissions for Cloud9
- **Resource Limits**: AWS service limits and quotas
- **State Conflicts**: Terraform state management issues
- **Network Connectivity**: VPC and security group configurations
- **Version Compatibility**: Terraform and provider versions

### 2. Error Handling Patterns
```bash
# Always include error checking
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Command failed. Check your configuration."
    exit 1
fi

# Provide clear error messages and resolution steps
```

### 3. Validation Procedures
- Include verification steps after each major configuration
- Provide expected outputs for comparison
- Include troubleshooting sections for common issues

## Maintenance Instructions
