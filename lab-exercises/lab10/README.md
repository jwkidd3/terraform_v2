---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Exercise 10.1: Terraform Cloud Organization Setup (15 minutes)**

### Step 1: Create Terraform Cloud Organization
1. Go to https://app.terraform.io/
2. Sign up or sign in to your account
3. Create a new organization: `${username}-terraform-training`
4. Note your organization name for later use

### Step 2: Create Lab Directory and Configuration
```bash
cd ~/environment
mkdir terraform-lab10
cd terraform-lab10
```

**main.tf:**
```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }

  cloud {
    organization = "user1-terraform-training"  # Replace with your org name

    workspaces {
      name = "user1-terraform-cloud-lab10"      # Replace with your username
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}

variable "username" {
  description = "Your unique username"
  type        = string
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment identifier"
  type        = string
  default     = "terraform-cloud"
}

locals {
  name_prefix = "${var.username}-${var.environment}"

  common_tags = {
    Owner       = var.username
    Environment = var.environment
    ManagedBy   = "TerraformCloud"
    Lab         = "10"
  }
}

# Simple S3 bucket for demonstrating Terraform Cloud
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "demo" {
  bucket        = "${local.name_prefix}-demo-${random_string.suffix.result}"
  force_destroy = true

  tags = local.common_tags
}

resource "random_string" "suffix" {
  length  = 8
  special = false
  upper   = false
}

# S3 bucket versioning
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "demo" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.demo.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

# Simple EC2 instance
data "aws_ami" "amazon_linux" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "demo" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  user_data = base64encode(<<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    yum update -y
    yum install -y httpd
    systemctl start httpd
    systemctl enable httpd
    echo "<h1>Terraform Cloud Demo - ${var.username}</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    echo "<p>Managed by Terraform Cloud</p>" >> /var/www/html/index.html
  EOF
  )

  tags = merge(local.common_tags, {
    Name = "${local.name_prefix}-demo-instance"
  })
}
```

### Step 3: Create Outputs File
Create **outputs.tf:**

```hcl
output "s3_bucket_name" {
  description = "Name of the S3 bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.demo.id
}

output "instance_id" {
  description = "ID of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.demo.id
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  description = "Public IP of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.demo.public_ip
}

output "terraform_cloud_workspace" {
  description = "Terraform Cloud workspace information"
  value = {
    workspace_name = "user1-terraform-cloud-lab10"
    organization   = "user1-terraform-training"
    execution_mode = "remote"
  }
}
```

## üîß **Exercise 10.2: Workspace Configuration and Remote Execution (20 minutes)**

### Step 1: Create Terraform Cloud Workspace
1. In Terraform Cloud UI, go to your organization
2. Click "New workspace"
3. Choose "CLI-driven workflow"
4. Name: `${username}-infrastructure-lab9`
5. Description: "Lab 9 - Terraform Cloud Integration"
6. Click "Create workspace"

### Step 2: Configure Workspace Variables
In your Terraform Cloud workspace, add these environment variables:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (sensitive) - Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (sensitive) - Your AWS secret key  
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` - `us-east-2`

Add these Terraform variables:
- `username` - Your username (e.g., "user1")

### Step 3: Execute Remote Plans and Applies
```bash
# Authenticate with Terraform Cloud
terraform login

# Initialize with cloud backend
terraform init

# Create a plan (runs remotely in Terraform Cloud)
terraform plan

# Apply the changes (runs remotely in Terraform Cloud)
terraform apply

# Check outputs
terraform output
```

### Step 4: Monitor Remote Execution
1. Go to your Terraform Cloud workspace
2. Watch the run in progress
3. Review execution logs in real-time
4. Examine the plan details and resource changes
5. Approve the apply when prompted

## üöÄ **Exercise 10.3: Explore Terraform Cloud Features (10 minutes)**

### Step 1: Test Terraform Cloud Features
1. **State Management**: View state versions in Terraform Cloud UI
2. **Run Details**: Review plan output and apply status
3. **Variable Management**: Update variables through the UI
4. **Run History**: Review previous runs and changes

### Step 2: Test Your Resources
```bash
# Check outputs
terraform output

# Test the web server
curl http://$(terraform output -raw instance_public_ip)

# Check S3 bucket
aws s3 ls $(terraform output -raw s3_bucket_name)
```

### Step 3: Workspace Settings
1. **General Settings**:
   - Auto Apply: Keep manual for learning
   - Terraform Version: Note the version used
2. **Variables**:
   - Review environment vs Terraform variables
   - Update username variable if needed

## üîç **Exercise 10.4: Troubleshooting and Best Practices (5 minutes)**

### Step 1: Common Terraform Cloud Issues
Test these scenarios:
```bash
# Trigger a plan with an intentional error
# Add invalid configuration to main.tf temporarily
terraform plan

# Review error handling in Terraform Cloud UI
# Fix the error and re-run
```

### Step 2: Best Practices Demonstrated
Review what you've implemented:
- ‚úÖ **Variable Security**: Sensitive variables marked as sensitive
- ‚úÖ **Resource Tagging**: Consistent tagging strategy
- ‚úÖ **Remote State**: Centralized state management
- ‚úÖ **Workspace Isolation**: Separate workspace for different purposes
- ‚úÖ **Version Pinning**: Terraform and provider versions specified
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring Integration**: CloudWatch dashboard for visibility

## üßπ **Cleanup**
```bash
# Destroy infrastructure via Terraform Cloud (runs remotely)
terraform destroy

# Confirm destruction in Terraform Cloud UI
# Review the destroy plan before approving
```

This lab demonstrates the enterprise advantages of Terraform Cloud, providing centralized state management, remote execution, and the foundation for team collaboration while maintaining the same infrastructure-as-code principles you've learned throughout the course.
